	This function requires a little more knowledge of how the confounding will be allowed. 
	This means that some factor effects get muddled with other interaction effects, so it’s harder to distinguish between them).
	
	Let’s assume that we just can’t afford (for whatever reason) the number of runs in a full-factorial design. We can systematically decide on a fraction of the full-factorial by allowing some of the factor main effects to be confounded with other factor interaction effects. 
	This is done by defining an alias structure that defines, symbolically, these interactions. These alias structures are written like “C = AB” or “I = ABC”, or “AB = CD”, etc. 
	These define how one column is related to the others.
	
	EXAMPLE
    ------------
    For example, the alias “C = AB” or “I = ABC” indicate that there are three factors (A, B, and C) and that the main effect of factor C is confounded with the interaction effect of the product AB, and by extension, A is confounded with BC and B is confounded with AC. 
	A full- factorial design with these three factors results in a design matrix with 8 runs, but we will assume that we can only afford 4 of those runs. 
	To create this fractional design, we need a matrix with three columns, one for A, B, and C, only now where the levels in the C column is created by the product of the A and B columns.

	Plackett–Burman designs are experimental designs presented in 1946 by Robin L. Plackett and J. P. Burman while working in the British Ministry of Supply.(Their goal was to find experimental designs for investigating the dependence of some measured quantity on a number of independent variables (factors), each taking L levels, in such a way as to minimize the variance of the estimates of these dependencies using a limited number of experiments. 
	
    Interactions between the factors were considered negligible. The solution to this problem is to find an experimental design where each combination of levels for any pair of factors appears the same number of times, throughout all the experimental runs (refer to table). 
	A complete factorial design would satisfy this criterion, but the idea was to find smaller designs.
	
	These designs are unique in that the number of trial conditions (rows) expands by multiples of four (e.g. 4, 8, 12, etc.). 
	The max number of columns allowed before a design increases the number of rows is always one less than the next higher multiple of four.

		* The design should be sufficient to fit a quadratic model, that is, one containing squared terms, products of two factors, linear terms and an intercept.
		* The ratio of the number of experimental points to the number of coefficients in the quadratic model should be reasonable (in fact, their designs kept it in the range of 1.5 to 2.6).*estimation variance should more or less depend only on the distance from the centre (this is achieved exactly for the designs with 4 and 7 factors), and should not vary too much inside the smallest (hyper)cube containing the experimental points.

		* A set of center points, experimental runs whose values of each factor are the medians of the values used in the factorial portion. This point is often replicated in order to improve the precision of the experiment;
